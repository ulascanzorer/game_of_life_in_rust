# Conway's Game of Life implementation written in Rust

![rust_crab](https://rustacean.net/assets/rustacean-flat-happy.png)


A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life. It uses egui in order to visualize the game.

# How to use

Simply run `cargo run` to see the visualization. Currently you can only decide the grid size of the game by modifying "main.rs". Also, there is currently no way to initialize (for example draw) cells in the beginning, the program simply generates a random configuration.
